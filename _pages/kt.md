Dailove Limited
======
With the support from PolyU's Microfund and HK Science Park's incubation program, I co-found Dailove Limited and Meditech products --AI and sensor-tech medication management solution -- are under development.

Meditech envisions a future where aging individuals enjoy enhanced independence, well-being, and connectivity through our revolutionary AI and sensor-tech medication management solution. Our flagship product, the Smart Pillbox V1.0, represents the culmination of years of dedicated research and development. This flower-shaped device, equipped with an interactive app, serves as a beacon of safety for elders by seamlessly combining medicine reminders, one-key emergency calling, and GPS positioning. More than just a technological marvel, it encapsulates our commitment to creating a household and outdoor safety ecosystem that is both user-friendly and economically accessible.

Meditech's flagship product, the Smart Pillbox V1.0, is a groundbreaking medication management solution designed to empower elders by seamlessly integrating into their daily lives. The flower-shaped device, coupled with an interactive app, encompasses a myriad of features tailored to enhance the medication experience for the elderly.
Concept:

The concept revolves around creating a user-friendly, aesthetically pleasing device that not only reminds elders to take their medication but also provides a comprehensive safety ecosystem. The interactive app acts as a centralized hub, connecting the device to a broader health management system.
