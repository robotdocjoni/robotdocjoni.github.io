My research in optimization with human-feedbacks focuses on developing intelligent systems that learn and adapt based on human input and interaction. My work on human-in-the-loop PID control based on CACLA reinforcement learning (Zhong & Li, 2019) and incremental learning frameworks for skeletal-based hand gesture recognition (Li et al., 2019) demonstrates my expertise in creating systems that optimize their performance through human feedback. Additionally, my research on adaptive boosting for occupancy estimation using heat-maps (Naser et al., 2020) and a biological inspired improvement strategy for particle filters (Zhong & Fung, 2009) showcases my contributions to developing optimization techniques that incorporate human knowledge and input. These works build upon seminal research in human-in-the-loop optimization, such as interactive machine learning (Fails & Olsen, 2003) and human-centered computational intelligence (Pedrycz & Chen, 2016).
